# scale-caluculator-2022

This app should help you find and understand chords and keys in music, with visual aids for piano and guitar.

This is an old project from 2014, revamped with Vue3.

Todo:

- [x] Have the modes reflect the actual keys
- [ ] Allow chord notes to be played either simultaneously, with fast arpeggio or with slow arpeggio
